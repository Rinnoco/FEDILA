# FEDILA

Welcome to FEDILA, a pioneering software solution designed to revolutionize analytic computations of the fundamental forces in the universe. Developed using Mathematica, FEDILA optimizes computations both in the continuum and on a spacetime lattice, paving the way for advanced research in Quantum Field Theories.

## Features

- **Optimized Computations**: Focuses on both continuum and discretized versions of theory on a spacetime lattice.
- **Flexible Mathematica Package**: Handles a diverse spectrum of renormalization schemes.
- **Advanced Renormalization Schemes**: Includes continuum Gauge Invariant Renormalization Scheme.
- **Supersymmetric Theories Support**: Capable of extracting information and performing calculations specific to Supersymmetric Theories.
- **Graph Theory Application**: Utilizes Graph Theory principles for efficient perturbative computations.
- **Multi-Scheme Feynman Diagram Calculations**: Ready to calculate Feynman diagrams across various renormalization schemes, theories, and regularizations including dimensional and lattice.

## Primary Goals

FEDILA aims to enrich the field of Quantum Field Theories by:
- **Enhancing Supersymmetric Field Computations**: Expanding the existing set of programs to encompass supersymmetric fields.
- **Incorporating Improved Lattice Actions**: Integrating features of improved lattice actions.
- **Extending Feynman Diagram Computations**: Supporting computations beyond one-loop order.

## Impact

The development of FEDILA not only accelerates research processes but also enables deeper exploration into theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and their supersymmetric versions. This automation promotes richer educational experiences, providing researchers and students alike with a profound understanding of the fundamental interactions and properties of subatomic and composite particles.
